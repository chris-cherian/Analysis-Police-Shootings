# Analysis-Police-Shootings
# Exploratory Data Analysis on Police Shootings in the USA

### Ever since the incident that occured on 25th of May, 2020 and the Black lives matter protest that happened all over the USA, there has been continous debate about what must be done in order to curb police brutality and to make the Criminal Justice System more effective and well... just. Is it a perpetuation of systemic racism, a case of false justice or backlash because of the USA's loose and unregulated gun laws.

### With the help of this dataset which is along with a plethora of other datasets is available on kaggle [Data on Police Shootings](https://www.kaggle.com/mrmorj/data-police-shootings). I will use techniques of Exploratory Data Analysis to understand information on the shooting, age ranges of the victims, gender ratio of the victims, race distribution of the people shot and their effects on police shootings. Which state did it happen in? Was the incident recorded? Did the suspect flee? Does ethnicity play a factor? I will use data analysis to draw corelations and list out my inferences and conclusion.

Libraries used in project : 
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) : a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) : a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) : a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) : a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Thanks [Jovian](https://jovian.ml/) for the course project.
